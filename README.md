# OSDi Generative AI Experiments

This repository contains the full transcripts of the conversations conducted with generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models during the experimental phase of the research project:
“Ontology-Guided Generative AI: A Prompt Engineering Study in Health Economic Evaluation Models.”

This project aims at exploring the potential of an ontology (https://w3id.org/ontologies-ULL/OSDi) to serve as a framework to streamline the early stages of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) modeling and support expert-driven processes.
 
Currently, the repository contains a first round of conversations, corresponding to a series of structured prompts sent to ChatGPT o-4.1 and Perplexity Deep Research as part of a factorial experimental design. During these conversations, the GenAI model is requested to generate structured instances relevant to HTA, using varying levels of contextual information and reproducing typical case uses for the HTA community.

## Folder structure

* **[UC1/](UC1/)** – Use case 1: Basic prompts with minimal context (PICO + task only). This use case represents early-stage/exploratory modeling, addressing the challenge of conceptualizing a decision problem when specific evidence is scarce

* **[UC2/](UC2/)** – Use case 2: Prompts with conceptual model context. This use case reflects the systematic population of parameters, simulating the transition from an established disease structure to a data-filled model.

* **[UC3/](UC3/)** – Use case 3: Full-context prompts based on a complete HTA report. Thus, it represents the automation of evidence extraction from technical reports, addressing the resource-intensive task of translating extensive HTA documentation into structured computational inputs
